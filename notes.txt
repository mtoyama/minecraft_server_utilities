Interesting server commands: 
	/say <message>
	/save-all //writes all pending changes to disk
	/stop //writes all pending changes to disk and shuts down server
	/playsound <sound> <player> [x] [y] [z] [volume] [pitch] [minimumVolume]

Flow:
Command line console application
	launch parameters: <start> <autoshutdown on/off>
	live inputs:
		server commands
		restart <delay>
			Messages out to server that it's restarting in <delay>. Runs a stop,
			then fires up start script again.
			Optional param for delay: "now". Shuts down server immediately.
		stop <delay>
			Messages out to server that it's stopping in <delay>. Runs a stop.

		backup
			Backs up the server. Need some kind of timestamping / revolving system
	configurations:
		server path
		startup script path
		number of revolving backups

Open questions:
How do we call a shutdown from within the program?
How do we separate application commands from minecraft server commands?
